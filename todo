- show disassembly in debugView

Disassembly will show ROM, along with RAMs
ROM doesn't change, iterate over it.

How to do it with imGui in effective way.

RAM does change.

PC <- index

Disassembly read all ROM (not RAMs) in once and dump it.

Disassembly is a state, shouldn't run like a game.
PC should iterator 0x0000 -> 0xFFFF
and show what is in there.

opcode              -> scf, rr A, nop, ...
opcode immediaten8  -> ld A, 0x10
opcode immediaten16 -> ld SP, 0xffff

PC | [PC]              opcode
PC | [PC] | [PC]       opcode immediate_n8
PC | [PC] | [PC][PC+1] opcode immediate_n16

- decode and show cartridge header, cartridge ram size depends on it

- Is SBC instruction half carry setting proceduce correct?

- Visually show VRAM, requires VRAM stub, and implementing cycle counts

- setup Github Actions

- implement halt instruction, requires interrupt stub?

- write the bootrom and set it up to run it on upfront before execute rom

- put size literals like _KiB and friends into literals namespace?

- fix tmbl rr instruction
